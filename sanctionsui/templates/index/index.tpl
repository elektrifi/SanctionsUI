This demo is an introduction to the capabilities of Elektrifi's Sanctions Screening service.
 <ul>
 	<li>You can test security and access control by logging in to the service.</li>
 	<li>You can manually key in a selection of your test data to check how the scoring system works.</li>
	<li>You can upload a file of your test customer data to see how the production processes work.</li>
 </ul>
 We've applied just a few restrictions to the demo compared to the production service:  
 <ul>
 	<li>You'll use a demo account rather than set up your own individual account.</li>
 	<li>You won't assume an administration role.</li>
	<li>You can upload a small file (< 10K) of your test customer data.</li>	
 </ul>    
To start, login using the link in the right-hand pane. We've preset the credentials for you to make it easy.<p />
